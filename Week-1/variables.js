//I used let to create a variable (age) and then changed its value.

//I used const to store values that do not change, such as birthYear and myBirthCountryAndCity.

//I used console.log to print values to the console.

//I created string variables to store country names and a simple text message.

// Created a variable using 'let' and assigned an initial value
let age = 25;

// Updated the value of the variable
age = 26;

// Created a constant for birth year (value does not change)
const birthYear = 2004;

// Printed birth year to the console
console.log(birthYear);

// Created a constant to store birth country and city
const myBirthCountryAndCity = "Tajikistan, Dushanbe";

// Printed birth country and city to the console
console.log(myBirthCountryAndCity);

// Created variables to store country names
let countryOne = "USA";
let countryTwo = "Russia";

// Created a variable to store a text message
let helloWorld = "Whatever world";
